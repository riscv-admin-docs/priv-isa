# Privileged ISA Charter

The Privileged ISA committee is responsible for overseeing the Privileged Architecture Specification, intended to be suitable for embedded systems and Unix-like operating systems, and for overseeing its growth through architecture extensions developed by Task Groups created under the committee's oversight.

This includes ensuring that proposed privileged architecture extensions are consistent with the overall RISC-V Privileged architecture and with the strategy and concerns of the horizontal committees.

The committee is also responsible for review of all proposed privileged architecture extensions, and for new opcode and CSR assignment in conjunction with the Unprivileged ISA committee.
